# Olympic-data-analysis

The olympics is one of the biggest and might be the most important sport event on earth where all the top athletes from all over the world compete, where we can see the limits of human body and inspire stories.

The most important thing in professional sports is performance. This will likely have a correlation with physical indicators. In this project I will explore the correlation between basic metrics such as height, weight, age and athletes' performance (the medals they win). Along with that, I also want to learn more about special/unusual cases in the data sample.

For this exercise, you will be a group of data analysits tasked with giving a data story to help the national olympics commite build the next olympics team, what they should focus on? and how can you prove that?
